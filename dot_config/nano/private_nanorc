## Enable vim-style lock-files.  This is just to let a vim user know you
## are editing a file [s]he is trying to edit and vice versa.  There are
## no plans to implement vim-style undo state in these files.
set locking

## Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled,

## Paint the interface elements of nano.  These are examples; there are
## no colors by default, except for errorcolor and spotlightcolor.
# set titlecolor bold,white,blue
# set promptcolor lightwhite,grey
# set statuscolor bold,white,green
# set errorcolor bold,white,red
# set spotlightcolor black,lightyellow
# set selectedcolor lightwhite,magenta
# set stripecolor ,yellow
# set scrollercolor cyan
# set numbercolor cyan
# set keycolor cyan
# set functioncolor green

# ## In root's .nanorc you might want to use:
# set titlecolor bold,white,magenta
# set promptcolor black,yellow
# set statuscolor bold,white,magenta
# set errorcolor bold,white,red
# set spotlightcolor black,orange
# set selectedcolor lightwhite,cyan
# set stripecolor ,yellow
# set scrollercolor magenta
# set numbercolor magenta
# set keycolor lightmagenta
# set functioncolor magenta

## To include most of the existing syntax definitions, you can do:
include "/usr/share/nano/*.nanorc"

## In /usr/share/nano/extra/ you can find some syntaxes that are
## specific for certain distros or for some less common languages.

## If <Tab> should always produce four spaces when editing a Python file,
## independent of the settings of 'tabsize' and 'tabstospaces':
extendsyntax python tabgives "    "

## If <Tab> should always produce an actual TAB when editing a Makefile:
extendsyntax makefile tabgives "	"

## If you would like nano to have keybindings that are more "usual",
## such as ^O for Open, ^F for Find, ^H for Help, and ^Q for Quit,
## then uncomment these:
bind ^X cut main
bind ^C copy main
bind ^V paste all
bind ^Q exit all
bind ^S savefile main
bind ^W writeout main
bind ^O insert main
set multibuffer
bind ^H help all
bind ^H exit help

bind ^D findprevious all
bind ^R replace main
